You are working on a backend of an e-commerce platform. The system fetches a list of all orders placed in the last 24 hours.
Each order has a list of products and each product belongs to a category.

Now, you are asked to generate a report that shows for each product category the total quantity of items sold, but only include
order when the total value is more than 500, and exclude any product that marked as out of product even if it was part of the order.

The report must be sorted by total quantity in descending order.

How would you approach writing this logic using Java 8 stream, keeping performance and readability in mind?

Generate a report
1.For each product category
2.From order in the last 24 hour with total value > 500,
3.Exclude products that are out of stock
Group by category
Sum of total quantity sold per category
Sort by total quantity descending
